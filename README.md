# Core package for AvoRed Shopping Cart
AvoRed Framework contains the core features for the AvoRed E-commerce for Laravel. It is the base behind the AvoRed and Laravel Ecommerce.

## Requirements
At this stage the minimum Lavarel version required is 5.8. If you are using an older version, let us know at our [Discussion Forum](https://avored.com/discussion). We can test if it works and add support for that version too.

## Installation
The AvoRed E-commerce framework is provided as a composer package, so it makes installation of AvoRed as easy as:

     composer require avored/framework

Once this is finished, you will need to run a few commands to finish up and then you are ready to roll.

## Publish the files
Publish the AvoRed E-commerce framework config file and assets (JS/CSS and images):

    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="AvoRed\Framework\AvoRedServiceProvider"

Once all the files are published, we can run the command to install the required database tables.

    php artisan avored:install

We are almost there. Now create your Administrator Account by running:

    php artisan avored:admin:make


That's It. 

Now visit:

    yoursiteurl.com/admin
